 - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03698)
 
Here are the results you should expect from each script.
These plots are generated with [viskit](https://github.com/vitchyr/viskit) 
with smoothing on.

Note that [RIG](RIG.md) is a special-case of Skew-Fit with `power=0`.

These examples require [multiworld](https://github.com/vitchyr/multiworld) to be installed.
